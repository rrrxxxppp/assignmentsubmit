##This is the steps how I create the tidy dateset:
*Download zip file
*Read the tables
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
*Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
